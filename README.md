# MetaPort

### STATUS: WORKING
- It, works as intended with multi-instance and now has truly portable version. Further development includes...
1. Refinement of printed text.

## DESCRIPTION
- MetaPort is two batches placed in the MetaTrader 5 directory that neatly runs, MetaTrader and MetaEditor, in Portable mode, as such it uses its own directory to store, all or most, of the files. You will not be using Both, multi and single, versions, either you need to use one account between multiple computers, or you want to use multiple accounts on the same computer. Multiple instances means you will be able to mess around on a demo account, while not altering the main trader insterface configuration, this is VERY useful, and prevents accidental closure of charts when closing tabs related to backtesting.
1. Run multiple accounts/instances on the same machine, for example, one forForex and one for Metals (with the Multi-Versions). Though this still uses "%APPDATA%\MetaQuotes\", and so is not able to be used between different machines.
2. Run single accounts/instances on any machines, for example, take it with you to work/home/holiday (with the Single-Versions). The thing is, and I WARN YOU EXPLICITLY, when you run single version it will delete the "%APPDATA%\MetaQuotes\" folder, as it needs to create a symbolic link in its place, that points to the portable directory. This is the solution to using "%APPDATA%\MetaQuotes\". You could run it off a memory stick or the likes, I could see how day-traders would find that useful.

### FEATURES
- **Infinite Licenses**: To not run out of activations on Expert Advisors, for example when you reinstall the OS (Single Version).
- **Multi-Instance**: Run multiple accounts in multiple Metatrader windows (Multi Version).
- **Clear Interface**: Text confirmations with short wait commands, explaining what is going on.
- **Self-Termination**: The batch closes itself after running MetaTrader.
- **Auto-Folders**: Automatic creation of required folders, ".\Temp" and ".\MetaQuotes" (Single Version).

## REQUIREMENTS
- Windows with scripting host enabled.
- Installation of MetaTrader 5.

### USAGE
1. Copy your MetaTrader 5 program directory to a safe location, such as for example `DRIVE:\PARENT FOLDER\Meta-Port`, somewhere that dont have permission issues, ie not `C:\Program Files\SOME FOLDER`.
2. Put, `MetaPort-TradeMulti.Bat` and `MetaPort-EditMulti.Bat` in same dir as "Terminal64.exe", or if you only intend to use, one account on one instamce, then you can make it fully portable with, `MetaPort-TradeSingle.Bat` and `MetaPort-EditSingle.Bat`, see explenation in "DESCRIPTION" section. You will not be using Both, multi and single, versions, either you need to use one accound between multiple computers, or you want to use multiple accounts on the same computer.
3. If you are using the multi-version, then ensure to create 1 copy of the Portable folder with the batches, for each account you intend to use, and name the folders relevantly.
4. Run, `MetaPort-TradeMulti.Bat` by double clicking it, or `MetaPort-TradeSingle.Bat` by right click "Run As Admin", therein, the admin can be assigned if you make it into a shortcut, then do the cmd.exe /c thing detailed in "NOTATION" section below.
5. Set your stuff up again in MetaTrader 5, it will save for next time after you close MetaTrader 5, like normal

### NOTATION
- If you have issues, and dont mind potentially corrupting your install, then you can run `Take Ownership` on the portable MetaTrader 5 directory, I found some settings were not saving otherwise, but I also found this not neccessary at other times.
- If you intend to run multiple "MetaPorts", then use a command such as `start /min "" ".\terminal64.exe" /portable` in the batch instead, soes they all start minimized. 
- If you want a shortcut to the batch, ensure the Target field looks like this `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c "DRIVE:\PATH TO BATCH\Port-Trade.Bat"`, if you want it on your TaskBar.
- Do not copy across activated EAs from your normal install to the portable directory, this will not work.
- Issues with multi-core now fixed, phew, almost resulted to reinstalling my OS, and even as a last resort installing a beta Motherboard Bios.
  
## DEVELOPMENT
- Use same theme of windows and text as my other batch launchers.
